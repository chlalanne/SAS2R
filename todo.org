** TODO Check the sepsis study (why logistic reg instead of survival model?)

 [[file:~/git/SAS2R/main.rnw::Based on a logistic regression model, the authors presented a summary of a Type III analysis of effects. Here is what can be done in R. First, we will slightly re arrange the data table so that we have a working data frame with total counts for successes (here, dead patients) and failure (patients still alive) in separate columns, together with columns describing strata and treatment levels.]]
** TODO Merge local bibliography with centralized Bibtex file

 [[file:~/git/SAS2R/main.rnw::\bibliography{refs}]]
